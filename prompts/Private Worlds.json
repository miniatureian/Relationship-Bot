    "What's something you've never told me about your inner monologue - how you talk to yourself when you're stressed or excited, etc?",

    "When was the last time you felt deeply nostalgic, and what triggered it?",
    "What's a guilty pleasure you'd hate outsiders to know about?",
    "What's a small, private victory you've had recently that no one else noticed?"
